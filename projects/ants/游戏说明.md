To start a text-based game, run

`python3 ants_text.py`

To start a graphical game, run

`python3 gui.py`

The game has several options that you will use throughout the project, which you can view with 

`python3 ants_text.py --help`

```
usage: ants_text.py [-h] [-d DIFFICULTY] [-w] [--food FOOD]

Play Ants vs. SomeBees

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -d DIFFICULTY  sets difficulty of game (test/easy/normal/hard/extra-hard)
  -w, --water    loads a full layout with water
  --food FOOD    number of food to start with when testing
```

Once you've finished this problem, play a game that includes water. To access the `wet_layout`, which includes water, add the `--water` option (or `-w` for short) when you start the game.

`python3 gui.py --water`
